/**
 * The Transient wordmark: lowercase "transient" with the dot of the "i"
 * replaced by a filled circle in the primary color (section 6.4).
 *
 * Drawn as real text, not outlined paths or SVG <text>, for one specific
 * reason: the accent dot has to sit over the "i". An SVG would need a
 * hardcoded x-coordinate measured against Inter's metrics, which silently
 * slides off the letter the moment the webfont fails to load and a fallback
 * is substituted. Here the dot is absolutely positioned inside an
 * inline-block wrapping *only* the dotless "ı", so it tracks that glyph's own
 * box whatever font resolves. Everything is sized in `em`, so the mark scales
 * with whatever font-size the caller sets.
