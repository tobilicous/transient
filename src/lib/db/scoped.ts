 * That lint rule is the enforcement; this file is the implementation.
 *
 * Two axes of visibility, and they are different questions:
 *
 *   1. Tenancy — which company owns the row. Never optional, never role-
 *      dependent. A cross-company read is a bug at any privilege level.
 *   2. Scope — which of that company's rows this actor may see, from section 8:
 *        GUARD       assigned sites; own reports and receipts
 *        SUPERVISOR  assigned sites; all shifts and reports at those sites
 *        ADMIN       every site in the company
 *        OWNER       admin, plus company settings and deletion
 *
 * Both are expressed as relational filters rather than by pre-loading the
 * actor's site ids, so the database does the join and the filter cannot drift
 * out of date between the load and the query.

     * and works it, and the schedule is written afterwards, or never. Without
     * this the dashboard has nothing to offer and the guard cannot work.
     *
     * Idempotent on `clientId`, for the same reason `clockIn` is: this is the
     * first tap of the night, on whatever signal the door has, and it will be
     * tapped twice. `upsert` on the unique `clientId` makes the second tap
     * return the first shift rather than open a duplicate one.
     *
     * The scheduled window is the claim the guard is making — "I am on from
     * now until roughly then" — so it is stored rather than left null, and the
     * report later shows scheduled against actual like any other shift.
