/**
 * `GET /api/audit/export` — the bulk audit-log export.
 *
 * Two gates, in this order, because they answer different questions and only
 * one of them is safe to answer honestly. `canViewAudit` decides whether this
 * person may see the log at all and returns 404, exactly as the page does, so
 * a plan response can never confirm to a guard that a company audit log
 * exists. Only once someone is allowed to see it does the plan get a say.
 *
 * The 402 is the only one in the app. This is the one place where the honest
 * answer really is "your plan does not include this", and saying that plainly
 * beats a 403 that reads like a broken permission. Nothing in
 * `ALWAYS_INCLUDED` can reach this path: reading the log on screen is never
 * gated, only bulk extraction of it is.
