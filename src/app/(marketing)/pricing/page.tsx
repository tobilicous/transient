            If both of us pay, are you billing twice for one building?

          <p className="max-w-3xl text-pretty text-text-muted">
            Yes, and here is the honest reasoning rather than a dodge. The guard company
            is paying to run the work. You are paying for oversight across vendors you
            do not employ, which is a different job and mostly a different set of
            screens. Your vendor&rsquo;s workspace stays theirs, your record stays
            yours, and neither of us can quietly edit the other&rsquo;s copy.
          </p>
          <p className="max-w-3xl text-pretty text-text-muted">
            If you employ your own officers, you are not a client in this sense. You are
            running the work, so the guard-company line is the one you want, and you
            should ignore the second half of this page.

              If a card expires on the night a building floods, the flood still gets
              logged, the photos still upload, the report still generates and it still
              sends. We will chase the bill in the app, loudly. We will not make billing
              status part of a legal record.

                No. A vendor you invite can log shifts and file reports into your
                workspace without buying anything. They pay us when they want Transient
                across their own book of business, which is their call and not a toll
                gate on yours.

                Never, on any plan, on either side. A report arrives as email with a
                PDF. The portal is for people who want to go looking through history
                themselves rather than dig through an inbox.

                You export it, including after you cancel. Reports are PDFs with a
                content hash printed on them, so they stay verifiable somewhere else
                without us. Holding a company&rsquo;s own evidence hostage is a business
                model we are not interested in.
