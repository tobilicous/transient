# Transient

Shift logging and reporting for contract security guards.

A guard clocks in on their phone, logs what happened as it happens — notes,
photos, incidents, patrols, property and blind-spot checks — and ends the
shift. The client gets a
PDF report in their inbox before the guard has left the parking lot, and the
supervisor can see whether it was actually delivered.

Built mobile-first and offline-first, because the people using it are standing
outside at 3am on a phone with one bar. Every entry is written locally and
queued; the timeline is honest about what has synced and what has not.

It sells to both sides of the same job: the **guard company** that needs proof
of work, and the **property or facility** that is paying for coverage and wants
to see it. Pricing for both is on the landing page.

## Quick start

You need **Node 22**, **pnpm 12** (`corepack enable` picks up the pinned
version), and a **Postgres 17**. Docker supplies the Postgres if you want it to,
but it is not a requirement — see below.

```bash
pnpm install && cp .env.example .env
pnpm db:up && pnpm db:migrate && pnpm db:seed
pnpm dev
```

That runs the whole product — auth, uploads, PDF generation, email delivery and
push — with **no third-party account and no network**. Local fallbacks stand in
for S3, Resend and a cron scheduler. Sign in at <http://localhost:3000> as
`owner@meridian.test`; the magic link is written to `.data/outbox/`.

`pnpm db:up` needs the Docker **daemon** actually running, not just the CLI
installed. If you would rather not run Docker, skip that step and point
`DATABASE_URL` at any Postgres 17 you already have — the app has no other
dependency on Docker, and `pnpm db:deploy && pnpm db:seed` will build the schema
from empty:

```bash
createdb transient
# DATABASE_URL="postgresql://<you>@127.0.0.1:5432/transient?schema=public"
pnpm db:deploy && pnpm db:seed && pnpm dev
```

Two things that will waste your afternoon if nobody tells you:

- **Run on port 3000, or change `AUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to match.**
  Sign-in links are built from those variables, not from the port the server is
  actually on. Start on `:3311` with the defaults and every magic link points at
  `:3000`, which fails quietly and looks like broken auth.
- **`PIN_SIGN_IN_ENABLED=1` turns on email + PIN sign-in.** It is off by
  default, so without it the only way in is a magic link. On a phone, or on a
  shared device, the PIN is the far better path.

## Run the iPhone or Android app

The `ios/` and `android/` folders contain Capacitor 8 **device-testing apps**.
They load the running Next.js backend; the database, uploads, email, and report
generation still run on the server. They are not store-release builds.

Install the project dependencies with `pnpm install`, then connect both native
projects to a working HTTPS deployment:

```bash
export MOBILE_APP_URL="https://your-project.vercel.app"
pnpm mobile:sync
```

Use the origin only, without a path or query. Export this variable in the same
terminal where you run the mobile commands; Capacitor does not load it from
`.env` or `.env.local`. Keep it set when building, and run `mobile:sync` again
when the backend URL changes. Without it, the app shows a setup screen.

### Android

Install **Android Studio**, **JDK 21**, and **Android SDK 36**. Set `JAVA_HOME`
to your JDK 21 installation. Open the project to configure the SDK location
and start an emulator or connect an Android phone with USB debugging enabled:

```bash
pnpm mobile:android
```

Build and install the debug APK from a terminal with `adb` on its `PATH`:

```bash
pnpm mobile:apk
adb install -r android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

The APK is signed for development and appears as **Transient** on the device.
If Android Studio is not being used, set `sdk.dir` in the ignored
`android/local.properties` to your Android SDK directory.

To use the local web server with an Android emulator instead of a deployment,
start it with the emulator address configured for authentication:

```bash
# Terminal 1: complete the database setup in Quick start first.
AUTH_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3000 NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3000 pnpm dev

# Terminal 2: these exports must stay set for both sync and build.
export MOBILE_APP_URL=http://10.0.2.2:3000
export MOBILE_ALLOW_HTTP=1
pnpm mobile:apk
adb install -r android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

`10.0.2.2` reaches the computer from the standard Android emulator. A physical
phone needs a reachable LAN address or HTTPS deployment. Next.js gives
`.env.local` precedence over `.env`; make sure an old deployment configuration
there does not override your local database settings.

### iPhone

Use a Mac with **full Xcode 26 or newer**; Command Line Tools alone are not
enough. With `MOBILE_APP_URL` still set to your working HTTPS backend:

```bash
pnpm mobile:sync
pnpm mobile:ios
```

In `ios/App/App.xcodeproj`, select the **App** target. For a physical iPhone,
set your signing team under **Signing & Capabilities**. Choose an iPhone simulator
or a connected iPhone as the run destination, then press **Run**. A physical iPhone may ask you
to enable Developer Mode. TestFlight distribution requires an Apple Developer
Program account and App Store Connect setup.

### Sign in and check the backend

Set `MOBILE_EMAIL_LINKS=1` on the backend to add an **Open in the iPhone / Android
app** link to sign-in emails. Use that link to create the session inside the
installed app. Email + PIN is another option when `PIN_SIGN_IN_ENABLED=1` and
the account already has a PIN. The sample seed does not assign PINs.

A hosted backend needs PostgreSQL credentials, authentication/signing secrets,
its HTTPS origin, persistent S3-compatible storage, and an email provider for
real delivery. Deployment is currently waiting for the existing database and
storage configuration. Native push notifications and offline cold launch are
not yet verified. See [the mobile guide](docs/mobile.md) for the complete device
checklist, current validation status, and Vercel test deployment instructions.

The script asserts every `<img>` decoded before it writes a file — a broken
image still produces a perfectly valid screenshot otherwise.

## Demo data

`pnpm db:seed` gives you a guard company, one site — Westside Hotel, on `FULL`
logging — two shifts, and four accounts you can sign in as:

| Account                      | Role       | What they see                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `owner@meridian.test`        | owner      | everything, plus plan and billing                                                      |
| `sup.westside@meridian.test` | supervisor | reports, delivery state, audit log                                                     |
| `guard.night@meridian.test`  | guard      | both seeded shifts at the hotel: last night's, finished, and one scheduled for tonight |
| `guard.swing@meridian.test`  | guard      | no shift assigned — the empty state                                                    |

`pnpm db:demo` goes further: it seeds, runs the background job sweep, seeds
again and sweeps again, which is what carries photos through thumbnailing and
reports through generation and delivery.

The order matters. The sweep is an **HTTP client** — it calls `/api/jobs/sweep`
on a running server rather than importing the job code — so:

```bash
pnpm start -p 3000 &                         # server first
SWEEP_URL=http://localhost:3000 pnpm db:demo # then the sweep
```

`SWEEP_URL` defaults to `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, so you only need it when the
server is on a different port than `.env` says. Point it at the wrong port and
the script tells you the address is wrong instead of parroting whatever
unrelated site answered.

Email delivery is deliberately not instant: the console provider confirms a
send about 20 seconds later, so a report legitimately shows `SENT` before it
shows `DELIVERED`. Two sweeps back to back is not a bug.

## How to use it

Three different people touch this product and they never see the same screen.
The fastest way to understand it is to walk the guard's shift end to end, then
look at it from the other two sides.

### 1. Get in

Go to <http://localhost:3000> and choose an account from the table above. The
guard flow needs a **guard**, so use `guard.night@meridian.test` — owners and
supervisors have no shift assigned and will never see a `Start shift` button.

Enter the email and submit. Nothing is emailed anywhere; the message is written
to disk instead:

```bash
grep -ohE 'http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback[^"]*' .data/outbox/*.html | tail -1
```

Paste that into the browser and you are signed in. It works once and expires in
10 minutes. With `PIN_SIGN_IN_ENABLED=1` you can set a PIN straight after and
skip the outbox entirely next time, which is what a guard on a shared phone
would actually do.

### 2. Work a shift

| Step           | What you tap                                                          | What happens underneath                                                                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Open the shift | `Start shift`, then `Clock in`                                        | A `Shift` row opens and the client-side store starts queueing to IndexedDB                    |
| Skip the intro | `Continue without the rest`, then `Go to timeline`                    | The onboarding wizard is optional every time                                                  |
| Log the shift  | Add notes, photos, incidents, patrols, property and blind-spot checks | Each entry is written **locally first**, then synced. The timeline shows per-entry sync state |
| Close it out   | `End shift` in the timeline header                                    | Opens the four-step end-of-shift flow                                                         |

The timeline is the product. Everything else exists to get something into it or
get something out of it. It is deliberately honest about sync state: an entry
that has not reached the server yet says so rather than pretending.

### 3. Send the report

The end-of-shift flow is four steps: review, build, send, clock out.

1. `Continue to report` — review what the client is about to receive.
2. `Build report` — renders the PDF. This is a **background job**, so it takes
   a moment rather than returning instantly.
3. `Continue to send`, then `Send report` — creates one `ReportDelivery` row per
   recipient and hands off to the email provider.
4. **Wait.** The screen moves itself to clock out once the send lands, measured
   at about 55 seconds against the deployed instance. You do not need to tap
   anything, and tapping `Send report` again is harmless — a job that has
   already reached `SENT` is not resendable, and `ReportDelivery` is
   `UNIQUE (reportId, email)` underneath as a second line of defence.
5. `Clock out` closes the shift.

Locally, jobs only run when something sweeps them. Start the server, then:

```bash
SWEEP_URL=http://localhost:3000 pnpm jobs:sweep
```

Email delivery is intentionally not instant — the console provider confirms
about 20 seconds after the send — so a report legitimately reads `SENT` before
it reads `DELIVERED`.

### 4. Look at it as the supervisor, and as the client

Sign in as `sup.westside@meridian.test` for the other half of the product:

- **`/reports`** — every report and its real delivery state: sent, delivered,
  opened, bounced. This is the answer to "did the client actually get it?", which
  is the question the guard company is being paid to answer.
- **`/audit`** — who changed what, and when. Exportable.
- **`/settings`** — plan, seats, entitlements (owner only).

The client never gets an account at all. They receive a signed link — `/r/[token]`
for the report, `/g/[token]` for the photo gallery, `/confirm/[token]` to confirm
receipt in one tap. Open one from `/reports` to see exactly what lands in their
inbox.

**Next.js 16** (App Router, React 19, TypeScript strict) on **Postgres 17 via
Prisma 7**, with S3-compatible object storage for photos and generated PDFs.

| `g/[token]`                                      | the client             | the photo gallery on its own                                                                             |
| `confirm/[token]`                                | the client             | one-tap confirmation that they received it                                                               |

`src/lib` is split by concern — `auth`, `db`, `storage`, `email`, `pdf`, `jobs`,
`push`, `media`, `speech`, `offline`, `validators`, `billing` — so API routes
stay thin enough to read in one screen.

### How a shift becomes a delivered report

1. The guard clocks in. A `Shift` row opens and the client-side store starts
   queueing entries in IndexedDB.
2. Every entry — note, photo, incident, patrol, property check, package,
   visitor, handoff — is written locally first and synced
   when the network allows. The timeline shows per-entry sync state, so nothing
   silently disappears.
3. Photos upload to object storage as the **original**. A background job
   re-encodes a thumbnail with `sharp`, strips EXIF GPS, and marks the media
   `PROCESSED`.
4. End of shift: the guard reviews everything, then sends. A `Report` row is
   created and the PDF is rendered with `@react-pdf/renderer`.
5. One `ReportDelivery` row is created per recipient. The email provider sends,
   and its webhook moves each row through `SENT → DELIVERED → OPENED`, or
   `BOUNCED`. That status is what the supervisor sees on `/reports`.
6. Retention runs on the same sweep: old media is pruned according to the
   company's policy, and every deletion is written to the audit log.

### Media is served through a signed redirect

`GET /api/media/[id]` authorises the caller, then 307s to a presigned URL.
Uploaded bytes are served `content-disposition: attachment` — an inline `.svg`
or `.html` from a user is same-origin script. Server-**derived** variants
(a `sharp` thumbnail, a generated PDF) are the exception: they are served
inline, the permission rides inside the _signed_ token so a caller cannot add
it to a URL, and a runtime allowlist limits it to `image/jpeg` and
`application/pdf`. If a thumbnail has not been built yet the URL falls back to
the original, which correctly downloads instead of rendering.

### Design system

Tokens live in `src/app/globals.css` in three layers: a literal palette, a
semantic layer that names roles rather than colours (`--surface`,
`--text-primary`, `--accent`), and a `@theme inline` bridge that makes Tailwind
utilities emit `var(--x)`. A class like `bg-surface` therefore follows the
active theme at runtime instead of freezing a value at build time.

Themes switch by toggling `.theme-dark` / `.theme-light` on `<html>`, set by an
inline pre-paint script so there is no flash of the wrong theme. The full
gallery — both themes, every primitive, every state — is at `/dev/ui`.

## Configuration

Every variable is read somewhere in the app. The ones marked **optional** have
a working local fallback, which is what lets the quick start run offline.

| Variable                                                                                              | Required        | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Switching storage

Storage sits behind one interface (`src/lib/storage/driver.ts`): `put`, `get`,
`delete`, `size`, `presignDownload`. Nothing above it knows which driver is
live.

**Local** (default) writes to `./.data/uploads` and presigns with a signed
token served back through `/api/uploads/local`. No account, no container.

**S3, R2, or MinIO** — set `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3` and fill the `S3_*` block.
`docker-compose.yml` already includes MinIO with a pre-made bucket:

```bash
STORAGE_DRIVER=s3
S3_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9000
S3_BUCKET=transient
S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true      # MinIO and R2 need this; AWS does not
```

For real S3 drop `S3_ENDPOINT`, set `S3_REGION`, and leave path style off.

**Neon Object Storage** is what the deployed build uses, because the database
already lives there and it keeps the deploy to one provider. The bucket is
declared in [`neon.ts`](./neon.ts) rather than clicked into existence:

```ts
export default defineConfig({
  buckets: { media: { access: "private" } },
});
```

`neon config plan` shows the diff, `neon config apply` creates the bucket and
writes `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3` and
`AWS_REGION` into `.env`. Those are AWS-conventional names; this app reads the
`S3_*` block, so copy them across:

```bash
STORAGE_DRIVER=s3
S3_ENDPOINT=https://<branch-id>.storage.<region>.aws.neon.tech
S3_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET=media
S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID from .env>
S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY from .env>
```

Two things to know. The endpoint is **branch-scoped** — a Neon branch gets its
own storage host, so a preview branch needs its own `S3_ENDPOINT` and will not
see production's objects. And Object Storage is region-limited (`us-east-1`,
`us-east-2`, `eu-central-1`, `ap-southeast-1`), so a project outside those
regions cannot enable it.

`access: "private"` is load-bearing. Every object is reached through a presigned
URL that the app mints only after checking the caller's company scope; a public
bucket would make that check decorative.

**Cloudflare R2** is the drop-in alternative and the better choice if egress
grows, since R2 charges none. Create the bucket, then an R2 API token (Account →
R2 → Manage API Tokens) scoped to Object Read & Write — that screen is the only
place the secret is shown. Its region is the literal string `auto`, and it needs
`S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE=true`. Nothing else changes: the driver is provider-
agnostic, so switching is these six variables and a redeploy.

Some providers issue _temporary_ credentials instead, signing with three fields
rather than two — AWS STS or an assumed IAM role. Handed only the first two,
those answer `InvalidAccessKeyId` on every request, which is what
`S3_SESSION_TOKEN` exists for. Neither Neon nor R2 needs it.

Add the bucket's public origin to the CSP in `next.config.ts` — the config
already threads a `storageOrigin` into `img-src`, `media-src` and `connect-src`
for exactly this.

### Switching email

Same shape (`src/lib/email/`): a provider interface with two implementations.
With `RESEND_API_KEY` unset, `ConsoleEmailProvider` renders each message to
`.data/outbox/*.html` plus a `.json` sidecar carrying the magic-link URL, and
simulates a delivery webhook so status tracking works offline. Set the key and
`RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to switch to Resend; point its webhook at
`POST /api/webhooks/resend`.

To add a third provider, implement the interface and register it — the report
pipeline talks to the interface, never to a vendor SDK.

### Adding a site

A **Site** is a place a guard is posted. It belongs to a `Company` and carries
its own areas, blind spots, entry types, logging mode, report footer and
recipients.

**Recipients have a UI; sites do not.** A supervisor or above can add, edit,
re-verify and remove recipients at `/sites/<id>/recipients`, reached from the
dashboard whenever an address bounces or has not confirmed. Everything else —
sites themselves, areas, blind spots, entry types and shift schedules — is
created in `prisma/seed.ts` and applied with `pnpm db:seed`, which upserts, so
editing and re-running is safe. Copy the `hotel` block near the top:

```ts
const site = await prisma.site.upsert({
  where: { companyId_code: { companyId: company.id, code: "WH" } },
  update: {},
  create: {
    companyId: company.id,
    name: "Westside Hotel — Sunset Strip",
    code: "WH",
    address: "8400 Sunset Boulevard, West Hollywood, CA 90069",
    timezone: "America/Los_Angeles",
    loggingMode: LoggingMode.FULL,
    sendIndividually: true,
  },
});

await upsertAreas(site.id, ["Lobby", "Loading dock"]);
await upsertBlindSpots(site.id, [["Garage P2", "No camera past the ramp"]]);
await upsertEntryTypes(site.id, [...]);      // what the guard can log here
await upsertShiftTemplates(site.id, [...]);  // the recurring posts
await upsertRecipients(site.id, [
  {
    name: "Ops",
    email: "ops@client.test",
    roleLabel: "Operations Manager",
    required: true,
    status: RecipientStatus.VERIFIED,
  },
]);
```

`loggingMode` decides how much the guard is asked for: `FULL`, `LIGHT` for
posts that mostly need presence, or `VERBAL` for dictation-first. Blind spots
are surfaced to the guard as known gaps in camera coverage rather than hidden
in a config file. `sendIndividually` gives each recipient their own delivery
row, so one bounce does not hide behind three successes — the seeded hotel
includes a deliberately bad address so the bounce path is exercised on a fresh
database rather than only in production.

### Who can read a shift, and who can write to one

These are two different rules, and treating them as one was a real bug.

**Across companies, nothing is shared.** A user from one company cannot read
another's sites. `tests/db/company-scoping.test.ts` asserts it directly, and
`check-auth` re-proves it through the browser.

**Inside a company, a shift is readable by everyone posted to that site and
writable only by the guard it belongs to.** The read has to be wide, because
acknowledging a handoff means reading the outgoing guard's shift. The write has
to be narrow, because the timeline is the evidence record that ends up in a
client's PDF, and nothing in that document would say an entry was not written
by the guard whose name is on it.

`tests/db/shift-writes.test.ts` covers every write path — entries, incidents,
packages, property and blind-spot checks, edits, strikes, handoffs — and each
test first asserts that the colleague's shift still _reads_, so narrowing the
read rule would fail them too. The one designed cross-guard write is the
`HANDOFF_GIVEN` entry on the outgoing shift, which is why ownership there is
asserted on the incoming side instead.

## Deploying to Vercel

For iPhone and Android device-testing builds, see [the mobile guide](docs/mobile.md).

1. Push the repo and **import it from Git**. Framework detection handles the
   build. Importing is also what wires pushes to deployments: a project created
   by running `vercel --prod` from the CLI has no Git connection, so `git push`
   builds nothing and every deploy stays manual until you run
   `vercel git connect`. Worth knowing before you assume a merged fix is live.
2. Provision Postgres and set `DATABASE_URL`. On a Vercel-managed Neon org the
   Neon CLI cannot create projects (`action restricted`); use
   `vercel integration add neon`, which provisions the database and writes
   `DATABASE_URL` into the project for you. Migrations do not run themselves —
   apply them with `DATABASE_URL="$DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED" pnpm db:deploy`
   before the first request. The unpooled URL is required because the pooler
   does not carry DDL.
3. Set every **required** variable above. `AUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
   must be the real `https://` origin — CSP emits
   `upgrade-insecure-requests` only when they are https, so an http value
   quietly opts out. Both are read at build time, so the first deploy of a new
   project is necessarily a throwaway: deploy once to learn the domain, set
   them, then deploy again.
4. Set `STORAGE_DRIVER=s3` with real credentials. The local driver writes to
   the filesystem, which does not survive a serverless instance. Set
   `S3_ENDPOINT` **before** that build — `next.config.ts` bakes it into the CSP
   at build time, so setting it afterwards leaves every image blocked.
5. Set `RESEND_API_KEY` and point the Resend webhook at
   `https://<your-domain>/api/webhooks/resend`.
6. Add a cron for the sweep. In `vercel.json`:

   ```json
   { "crons": [{ "path": "/api/jobs/sweep", "schedule": "*/10 * * * *" }] }
   ```

   Vercel sends its own bearer token, so `CRON_SECRET` must match it. Nothing
   in this repo applies migrations automatically — run `pnpm db:deploy`
   against the production database **before** promoting a build that needs a
   new column.

7. Create the first account. Transient has **no self-registration** by design,
   so a fresh deployment has nobody who can sign in and the sign-in form will
   answer identically whether or not the address exists. Run `pnpm db:seed`
   against the production database, or insert a `Company` and an admin `User`
   by hand, before expecting anyone to get in.

## Testing

```bash
pnpm verify        # typecheck → lint → format → contrast gate → unit tests
pnpm test:e2e      # Playwright, at both 390px and 1280px
```

`pnpm verify` runs `format:check`, so run `pnpm format` first if you have been
editing.

Database tests need a second database:

```bash
pnpm db:test:setup     # creates and migrates transient_test
pnpm test
```

### Browser gates

These drive a real browser against a running server and are the evidence
behind most claims in this README. Start a server, then point them at it:

```bash
pnpm start -p 3000 &
BASE=http://localhost:3000 AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 node scripts/check-landing.mjs
```

Use an explicit port. Port 3000 is a common collision, and `next start` failing
with `EADDRINUSE` while something else answers on that port produces a `200`
that proves nothing.

## Where the decisions are written down

`ASSUMPTIONS.md` records what was decided and what is deliberately not built,
including which subscription entitlements are enforced today and which are
listed but unimplemented. Read it before quoting a capability to anyone.

### Appearance and icons

Dark mode is the default. Use the moon/sun control to switch modes, or choose Dark, Light, or System in Settings → Appearance. For the palette, glass behavior, and icon regeneration instructions, see [docs/appearance.md](docs/appearance.md). Run `pnpm mobile:icons` to regenerate web, iOS, and Android assets from the shared vector source.

For a database-free preview of the **app interface**, run `pnpm dev` and open [http://localhost:3000/dev/app](http://localhost:3000/dev/app). It uses the app’s dashboard and settings components with clearly marked sample data. Real shifts and downloads require the backend setup above.
